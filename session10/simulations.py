I will create 2 functions.


Function 1: one simulation, which is rolling 100 dice, which means generating 100 randome numbers, and sum up.

1. initialize a variable `total` to store the sum
2. Loop the following `n` times:
   2.1 Generate a random number between 1 and 6
   2.2 Add the random number to total
3. Print the sum

Function 2: run the roll_dice 10 times
